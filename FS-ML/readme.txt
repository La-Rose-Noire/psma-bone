The full name of "FS-ML" is "feature selection and machine learning". The files in this directory are used for modeling and are divided into four feature folders: "RFs_CT_bin50" (CT Random Forests), "RFs_PET1_bin0.25" (including original and harmonized PET Random Forests), "RFs_PET2_bin0.05" (standardized PET Random Forests), and Baseline (traditional imaging features). Additionally, there is the original modeling code in "code-seed1" and the code for verifying model robustness in "code-seed11-21-31".
